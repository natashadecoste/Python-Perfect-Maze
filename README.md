# README for Python Perfect Maze

Natasha DeCoste 

********************************************

Initial Comments:

grapics.py was not created by myself, it is library for using python graphics. It does not need to be downloaded from this Repository.

stack.py is a simple library for creating stacks in python.

*********************************************

The main python function calls the Maze Class with one parameter 'N' (integer parameter). That creates a NxN "perfect maze". It then randomly places a "Key", which is an orange circle, into the maze. The Maze exit is the top left. The maze solves the most effiecient path to the Key and then from the Key to the Exit.

The Maze colours are retro Pac-Man themed which can be easily changed within the class.
